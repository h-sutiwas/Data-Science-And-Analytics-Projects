# Data Science & Analytics Projects
Welcome to my Data Science Projects Repository, this repository is a comprehensive collection of my projects in the field of data science. This repository showcase various projects spanning multiple domains including:

  **- Machine Learning**: Implementation of supervised and unsupervised learning algorithms, deep learning models, and natural language processing techniques.
  
  **- Data Visualization**: Creating insightful and interactive visualizations to communicate complex data patterns and trends.

  **- Statistical Analysis**: Applying statistical methods to extract meaningful insights and test hypotheses.

  **-Other Data Science Topics**: Including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model evaluation, and deployment.

  Each project demonstrates different aspects of the data science workflow, from data collection and cleaning to model building and interpretation of results. Whether you're a fellow data scientist, a student, or simply curious about data science, you'll find something interesting here.

## Projects
### 1. [Toman Bike Shop Analytics Dashboard](https://github.com/h-sutiwas/Data-Science-And-Analytics-Projects/tree/main/SQL%20Power%20BI%20Analysis%20Dashboard)
- **Description:** This project contains a business intelligence solution developed for Toman Bike Shop using Microsoft Power BI and SQL. The dashboard provides comprehensive analysis of the shop's performance across 2021 to 2022. The dashborad tracks key metrics including revenue, profit, rider demographics, and seasonal trends to support data-driven business decisions and pricing strategies for the bike rental operation.
- **Tools Used:** MS Power BI Desktop, SQL (SQL Server Management Studio), Power Query
- **Results:** The analysis reveals significant growth between 2021-2022, with total riders increasing from 1.24M to 2.05M and revenue growing from $4.96M to $10.23M. The dashboard identifies peak profitability during midday hours (10-15), particularly on Wednesday and Fridays. Season 3 generates the highest revenue ($4.9M), while registered riders constitute 81.17% of customers. Based on this insights, a 10-15% price increase strategy is recommended for the next period, with potential segmented pricing between casual and registered users.
